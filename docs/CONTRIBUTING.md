# How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this tool on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Testing

Validating the features of the tool with a wide variety of user profiles (with or without frozen crew, in a fleet or not, with or without profile picture, at various levels, etc.), and reporting back the results is always welcome.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/IAmPicard/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).

Particularly looking for folks with frontend (HTML / CSS) experience.

*Note:* I will not approve pull requests that automate any part of the game play. Not only would that be a violation of [Disruptor Beam's TOS](https://www.disruptorbeam.com/tos/), it would also enable cheating which I don't condone. Firstly, I'm a player of Star Trek Timelines and wand to enjoy the game as its authors intended for it to be enjoyed. Also, any feature that does not serve the primary purpose of helping with crew management will undergo heightened scrutiny.

## Statistics and algorithms

Features such as crew recommendations could definitely use the input of a more statistics-oriented person. Even if you're not a coder, suggesting ways to analyze the crew data and provide meaningful recommendations (even in plain english) would be a huge help.
